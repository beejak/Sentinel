# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include welcoming language, respect for different viewpoints, and constructive criticism.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at conduct@example.invalid. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/.
